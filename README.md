Amazon Product Review Analysis – Capstone Project  
By: Chidinma Victoria Nwosu

Project Overview:  
This project is part of my DSA Capstone. I used Excel to explore and analyze Amazon product review data. The goal was to find out how product pricing, discounts, and customer ratings are connected, and to draw useful insights from the data.

Tools Used:  
- Microsoft Excel (pivot tables, charts, and formulas)

Key Findings:  
- Some products had discounts as high as 94 percent, especially accessories like USB adapters.  
- Products like Amazon HDMI cables and boAt earphones were highly rated and had a large number of reviews.  
- Smartphones had the highest revenue potential, with a total over ₹38 billion.  
- There is a slight negative relationship between discount and rating.  
- 326 products had fewer than 1,000 reviews.
